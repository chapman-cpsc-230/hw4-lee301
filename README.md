## Description

In this assignment, we had to test functions if they do work. We also had to define histogram function and digits function.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to test functions and how to define such functions. I also learned how to draw a histogram using asterisks.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
